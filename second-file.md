Second file

Note: to "Save As" in TextEdit, you have to "duplicate file" and then save.

In Atom, there is a Save As option.

To save as a .md file instead of a .rtf file, uncheck "hide extension" in TextEdit.

In Atom, the extension is by default not hidden.

Atom seems to correspond more closely with my own ideas about how things should work.

I am adding one more line from the github website.  Will it show up in github desktop?
